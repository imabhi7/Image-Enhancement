# Image-Enhancement
As the title suggests the project takes blur images as input and then sharpens the given input image using functions from the libraries like open-cv and NumPy to obtain a more precise and sharper image. It also enhances the brightness and contrast of the resultant image and uses the MatPlotLib library to plot the graph of the histogram of the frequency of pixel V/S intensity of its brightness to give an idea about what exactly is going on in the project. The main idea behind the project is to obtain more clear images from their blurred version using python. Through it, one can get a clear picture which in turn can be used in various other fields including Crime Investigation- obtain clear images from CCTV, or in the field of medicine to obtain clearer X-Ray images/images of internal organs, or in the field of astrophotography, etc. In other words, it provides an opening to a whole new research/development algorithm.
